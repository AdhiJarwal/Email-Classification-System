Dear SBI customer, One Time Password (OTP) on email has temporarily been disabled for all INB activities done through INB and Yono. OTP will now be sent only by SMS on your Regd Mobile No. Further, OTP has now been made mandatory for all merchant (eCommerce) transactions irrespective of amount. Please ensure to register your domestic / international mobile number with the Bank records for seamless online transactions. Wishing you a Happy & Prosperous New Year!!
